# 🖐️ Virtual Hand Mouse using OpenCV & MediaPipe

This project leverages computer vision and gesture recognition to control the system mouse cursor using **hand gestures**. Built using `OpenCV`, `MediaPipe`, and `PyAutoGUI`, this Python GUI application allows users to move, click, drag, and scroll using only their **index, thumb, and middle fingers**—turning your webcam into a virtual input device.
